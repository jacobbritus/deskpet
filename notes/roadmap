🐾 AI Desktop Pet + Chatbot – Mini Roadmap with Time Phases
✅ Phase 1: Visual Pet Basics (1 day – Saturday)
 Create a Pygame window fixed at the bottom of the screen (simulate taskbar)

 Display a pet sprite that moves left and right

 Bounce back at edges

 Handle idle animation and walking state

✅ Phase 2: Add Pet Personality (1–2 days – Sunday-Monday)
 Add idle animations (sit, yawn, etc.)

 Cycle between walking and idle randomly

 Add simple "emotions" (happy, bored, sleepy)

 Show mood with emoji or speech bubble

✅ Phase 3: AI Chatbot Core (2 days – Tuesday-Wednesday)
 Add a text input box or popup for chatting

 Connect to OpenAI’s GPT API or local model (like llama.cpp or ollama)

 Design a simple loop: User types → Pet replies

 Make responses sound like a character (cute, sarcastic, etc.)

✅ Phase 4: Integration & Memory (1 day – Thursday)
 Keep chat history

 Store basic memory (e.g., your name, hobbies)

 Make pet say random lines when idle (based on personality or memory)

✅ Phase 5: Polish for Portfolio (1–2 days – Friday–Saturday)
 Pet reacts to chat tone (happy, confused)

 Add hotkey or button to open/close chat

 Add sound or simple SFX for mood changes

 Final testing, clean UI, record a short demo

💡 Total: 6–7 days
Fun to build, gradually increasing in complexity

Full of learning: GUI, animations, state machines, AI integration

A real "wow" project for your portfolio
