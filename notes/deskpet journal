im thinking about the mental aspect of this project, this pet could literally help people.
it could guess someone's mood and respond considering it
it's always there and can help with any question
it is cute and keeps your desktop lively

im thinking of changing the pet to a black cat since those are my favorite animal.
i could just have different animal types, hell even customizable
itd be cool for people if they could digitize their pet basically (ok wow that sounds really cool)
imagine your pet dying and it "living on" in your desktop (how melancholic, but sweet)

i really look forward to the chatbot function.
it'd much easier and accessible.

i also look forward to making cool and cute interactions
i really want the pet to have it's own personality
a bit human
like i can imagine the pet being annoying at times
but then sweet and cute
and then telling me about how the pyramids were made

- animation randomness could depend on personality
    - certain associated animations could appear twice in the list

- watch with me
    - option to let the AI bot check the screen and answer questions

thought:
i have never really had a pet, since it's not a part of my parent's culture

but someone i met made completely changed how i thought about having one

her love for cats was so unconditional which made it infectious in a good way

this developed a liking for cats within me, and now i want a cat

a black one specifically

cats are sooooo cute and seem so cozy to be around

i'll adopt one when i have my own house

anyhow the point of this rant is that this project could kinda act as a replacement until im able to get my own

i finished for today at 7:19

gotta go work...

im sooo excited to continue working on this.

things like, more animations, moods, personalities

other things like AI excites me too

the cat could be helpful in so many ways!!

be it emotional, productive, etc.

here are some chatGPT ideas:

            Add personality traits (e.g. "lazy", "curious", etc.) and let them influence animation probabilities

            Save state: moods, personality, time since last interaction

            Chatbot interface (OpenAI API or local rules-based chatbot)

            Minimal GUI (optional): basic settings, pet selector, mood log

            Deployable build (with tools like PyInstaller)

            üêæ Customizable pets: Let users upload their own art or choose from skins

            üß† Chat integration: Combine with OpenAI API for real-time conversation

            üå§Ô∏è Ambient responsiveness: Change moods based on time, weather, or user activity

            üßç Life companion: Help people track habits, guide routines, or just offer emotional support

            üë• Community: Let others share pet personalities, moods, or stories ‚Äî like a mini ecosystem

ok so this is gonna be a really fun and cool project

basically, i'm making a AI DESKTOP PET

gotta be honest, i stole this idea from a classmate

well, she didn't want to collaborate anyways...

anyhow, i started on:

the plan today is to get a CUTE animal walking around randomly using pygame.

i started off straight up RIPPING files from my recent pygame project.

i added a new function which includes randomly picking a W/A/S/D key.

at first i put the functions for walking and animations within the random_movement

not realizing that this caused those functions to only run once. or at least possible to (can't use while loops here AAA)

so i added two new class attributes called self.move_time and self.key

representing how long the sprite moves and animates and the which W/A/S/D key is chosen

i think it is pretty cool so far, haha.

i basically made a classic game npc

decided on making it 2d

to do:
- random moving time as well
- borders left and right

06:14
i woke up and got started on explaining the code using comment blocks

i just finished and it's looking nice and clear

im gonna start always explaining my code to test my understanding

oh yeah, yesterday i added borders

19:13

after a busy day, i finally was able to put some work in!

i planned to add in some more animations

while exercising in the morning, i this great revelation

i realized how i made the pet perform actions overcomplicated

i had:
- random key random.choice(["A", "D"]
- long if else statements like if key == "A", self.direction == right and move
- could only walk left and right or idle and only when in a small window before choosing random key again to stimulate a pause before walking


now:
- self.animation and self.direction is a random choice between all the animations and the two directions
- idle is a part of the animations list so no need for extra bs
- no need for the if else statements checking what key is chosen to change direction
- it is really easy to add more animations

i added two animations:
- sit
- flying

i didn't get to do much coding today, but i did something more important

solving a problem

leading to more efficient, scalable, shorter code

11th of June 2025
________________________________________________________________________________________________________
05:41

woke up and got rid of the wall bounce

while in the toilet, i decided finally what to focus on

mouse interaction!

i was sure pygame had methods for mouse usage, so i looked up documentation

found out how to get mouse position (pygame.mouse.get_pos())

and now i'm doing math to make the pet do something when its and the mouse's x and y positions are within range

07:06
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

after getting decent collision points, i have no clue where the exact x and y point of the mouse are taken from (like top left corner?)

anyhow, i looked up how to detect mouse press

found pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN

this has got to be checked within the for event type range loop

IF they're colliding, and mouse button down, the pet's x and y position are the mouse's position

this creates a drag effect

only, the mouse button down thing doesn't work as expected

the thing is, it does NOT wait for mouse down, it just starts dragging when collision point is met

i need to find a way to only perform this whole action WHEN the right mouse button is being held

anyhow, the sight of seeing the pet being dragged was really cool to see.

not using full tutorials, makes this really rewarding

REALISATION!

i could make the animations thing into a dictionary to be able to better deal with unique animation stuff like longer wait time with sit

it could be like:

animations = {"walk1": {"animation":"walk1", "action_time": 20 (200 ticks), "rarity": .............}

i still gotta think about how to implement action rarity

like some animations shouldn't appear as frequently as others right

the action value time could also change depending on other factors like personality or mood. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

OOO LIKE

sleep could have a standard wait time of 2000 ticks

17:30
i finished implementing a simple mouse interaction

dragging the pet to a different location on the screen is now possible!

20:30
i kind of crashed out

i was struggling like crazy, trying to get it to work properly -- it wasn't the pet was touching the left border

i was getting the mouse cords and pet cords and activating drag when divided by eachother was within a range

this obviously not working if any cords are at 0

so i just asked chatGPT and got taught about .collidepoint()

im glad i did, instead of painful trial and error

i realize that being too much against looking up information could also harm my growth

so, 30 minutes max trying to fix and issue myself, and only specific questions.

and i must document what i did wrong and what i learnt.

NEW DAY

today, i wanna work on my cat sprite.

i bought one and now i'm remodeling it to make it feel like my own.

i'll also be adding my own animations like walking

let's get started!

08:50

ok so i have been add it for a long time now lol

i never knew that making a sprite took this long

so far, i have just made the idle sprite black and gave the cat green eyes

and now, or like since 8:00 i have been creating a walk animation

it is so hard, i never realised

im having a lot of fun though

20:21

i finally finished it around 19:00 today

today i found out how hard, but fun pixel art is

i also made and added the dance sprite

i wanna add more animations and mouse interactions!!!!

like petting

as well as meows!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ii have to tomorrow

5:14
not sure what i'm gonna do..

i gotta work from 10 till 7 and the commute is an hour long, sigh

got started on more mouse interaction

i wanna make a pet feature

i started by changing how the cursor looks depending on the interaction

06:19

facing a bit of issues

found cursor sprites

added the code (messy rn, also gotta make cursor into a seperate class)

i got this warning: libpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile

apparently something's off with the cursor image

and now i gotta download a tool to get rid of the thing

07:19

yesssssss i did it

i got rid of that error

added two different cursors, one for grabbing and petting

i really like the petting cursor and cant wait to add feedback from the cat to make it look cuteeeee

didn't get to add meows unfortunately

tomorrow probably, work....

ANOTHER WORK DAY from 10:00 till 19:00

so i unfortunately can't put a lot of effort in.....

i really desire a full day of work, unbothered.

being able to make good progress.

anyhow, today im just gonna fix some cursor issues and maybe add some meows.

07:19

i fixed an cursor sprite bug, the original cursor didn't get hidden properly until i cleaned up the code?

then i added sounds by learning about pygame's mixer module

i really like the sounds, they make the cat way more alive

i'm gonna add minecraft cat sounds though i think

i should also add different sound effects per animations

so tomorrow:
- cut and add mc cat sounds: https://youtu.be/7pPiI-EHIeI?si=Y6ADqKEHPSspvQ1N
- make the meows appear random (longer cooldown)
- edit and add the other animations

if i got more time
- action weight
- random moods (speech bubble appears randomly and can check using middle mouse button)
- emotions like (happy, sleepy, sad)
- action weight change depending on mood

i edited and added two more animations: sleep and cry!

also, cat only meows once when random animation = idle

05:43
today i'm adding moods!!

so far i have:
- created my own speech bubble, the other one wasn't optimal
the pointer was centered which would look weird when the cat's doing certain animations
i made the pointer diagonal in the corner and gave it distance and it looks amazing
- i added a happy emoji to it from an emoji game asset!

- made a function for moods that changes which animations play

- added sleep mood

- added the original cat

- fixed how moods worked (first cooldown then change mood)

- i now am gonna work on all animations

ok so i added all animations for the beige cat

i added weights for the animations (some are rarer than others now, moody ones appear often)

i had to change a lot of stuff and do some debugging

there's this animation called DeadCat which is one image and that made the program crash at self.frame

im just gonna remove it since i don't like it anyways

11:03

i've been coding for such a long time haha

it's so much fun and i got so much progress done

i learnt how to use random.choice with weights

didn't even know it had more parameters

nevermind it is random.CHOICES

########################################################################
weights_list = ["mood", "common", "uncommon"]
weights = [0.5, 0.2, 0.1]
self.current_animation_weight = random.choices(weights, k=1, weights=weights)[0]
########################################################################
the number of weights have to match the number of possibilities

13:32
the cat now cleanly displays without a background it's so cool

gotta be honest, i copied and pasted from stackoverflow, but no way i'm learning such specific syntax im never using again.

anyhow, im asking chatGPT for improvements and implementing them.


improvements
################################################################
1. the sound function kept initialzing the mixer:

pygame.mixer.init()

this got called every frame which may cause stuttering

the solution is doing it once in the main script

2.  hardcoded the y-offset for the window position (putting it lower to get it on the taskbar)

    y = 890

solution = get an estimate

    # move window position down to have pet on top of taskbar
    screen_height = GetSystemMetrics(1) # get screen height
    window_height = 150 # game window height just to fit pet and speech bubble, else it'll be to laggy
    task_bar_height = 40 # estimation of the task bar height
    y = screen_height - window_height - task_bar_height # calculate the y position of the taskbar
    os.environ['SDL_VIDEO_WINDOW_POS'] = "%d, %d" %(0, y) # set the sprite on top of the taskbar

3. magic number in animations cooldown

solution: added constants

4. loaded image twice in speech bubble:

occurred when it was left and then had to flip if the border was reached

        load_image = pygame.image.load(image)

solution:
removed it and just flipped


# 5. nesting the animation info under rarities

            "common":{
                "idle": {"cooldown": base_cooldown, "weight": "common"},

instead of doing that, i nested the rarity under the animation it self with the cooldown info

                "idle": {"cooldown": base_cooldown, "weight": "common"},

it wasn't good cuz




#################################################################

started on AI but gave it up for now i wanna work on the base, the pet.

the cat becomes sleepy after 6pm

i added a new mood angry

added 2 new animations: angry idle and happy idle

i changed the way changing mood to happy works when petting

    1. i made a different function called uplift_when_pet

    2. 0.01 chance for pet to turn happy else keep same mood
    this makes uplifiting the pet a bit harder

18:58
added sleepy idle

19:39
i added sounds to represent the different moods

20:25
mood show only when changed in the cycle

07:16

good morning. today i started around 6:30 with pushing taskd

now i wanna make the speech bubbles look better by having them animated.

08:53

gave all speech bubbles an animation by creating frames and a new function responsible for iterating through the frames and returning each

after that i decided to go over the script to add in more explanation where was neccessary.

i started on an animation unique sounds (added one for sleep)

i then randomly got the idea to turn the mood change sounds to meme ones (sleep and angry)

i really like the angry one it makes me laugh.


####################################################################################
it is insane how fast the time goes when i'm coding.

i could ruminate about my responsibilities in the future, yet when i code it stops.

i would dread tomorrow while im free, only now i barely overthink about tomorrow.

for example, yesterday i coded the whole day and it went so fast haha.

chat gpt calls it flow state, makes sense.

time disappears, worries fade and the only thing that matters is what's in front of me.

i have found something that connects me to the present moment

i create from my soul rather than obligation

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7:30
oh yeah forgot well i started since 6:30 trying to find out what module im using for the gui

ok so after a full hour of trying to find a gui i can use with pygame,

i realised that i was looking for the wrong thing.

i was looking on websites, pygame documentation, stack overflow etc.

the problem being trying to use tkinter to move things in pygame which i don't need to do.

i just want to run tkinter when the pet is clicked simultaneously

which didn't work at first because both pygame and tkinter have their own mainloop which caused the pet to freeze.

now i'm trying to understand how threading works:

###############################################################################
threading basically allows both modules to run at the same time.

mainloop() from tkinter never ends until the window is closed - it hijacks control.

    threading.Thread(target=run_tk, daemon=True).start()

target is the thing to be threaded.

daemon = True, stops the threading if program is quit

###############################################################################

12:22 basically continued from 12:00

im trying to get the chat window to spawn close the cat

i need a way for to send the current cat position to the chat class

complete i did it, i do gotta add safety rails for if the cat's at the edge

but for now i just wanna push to mvp honestly, so ill get to integrating AI

13:41

i got it to working

when right clicking the cat, a chat window opens up

where users can ask an openai API anything

only it looks very old haha

today, ill either:

customize the chat window

or

give the AI personality (i think it is possible to add context in the creation of the bot, what i can do is have it take it information before getting a response)

context = "you're a human cat and you're currently {self.mood}"

get_response(context, user_input)

information like mood.

then later, i can also do personalities!

16:00

i continued designing the chat

19:00

i successfully integrated the AI chat to deskpet with the help of chatGPT,

i was against learning specific tkinter language as im probably not using it in the future and it is not the main focus

i also managed to make the openAI API client act like a cat and based on its current mood which is cool

tomorrow i want to improve the chat design and look into more ways of connecting the pet with the chat.

im glad, the project is basically a mvp now
________________________________________________________________________________________________________

18th of June 2025
________________________________________________________________________________________________________
07:26

today i started asking chatGPT for feedback on my project.

said it was good and i asked about connecting the chat with the pet for a better experience

which is what im doing rn.

im probably going to work on another project later though as i feel to tired to work on this too much today

ahhhh there is an issue with the chat

        Tcl_AsyncDelete: async handler deleted by wrong thread

im guessing that the chat has to be created and deleted in the same thread (function)

fixed, now multiple chats open..

apparently i cant run Tkinter and pygame mainloop properly at the same time

09:47

i still havent found a solution.

i tried pygame gui and prompted chatGPT to make me a chat

and now i'm like:

fine, illl do it myself.
